# Visualization

This folder in the repo contains the code for visualizing the outputs of the bot.

## Getting Started
The project is composed of a node.js backend and a react frontend. Install the following stuff
manually to get everything you need.
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  * `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
  * If homebrew is already installed just run `brew update` to update list of packages available
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * `brew install node`
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
  * `brew install yarn`
* Install backend dependencies
  * `cd backend; yarn`
* Install frontend dependencies
  * `cd frontend; yarn`

Then, to start everything up, first run the following in the backend directory:
- `yarn start`

Then, run the same thing in the frontend directory:
- `yarn start`
