# Beginners Luck

This project is a bot that automatically buys and sell the ethereum crypto-currency in an effort to make a profit (or at least minimize loss). It uses a double exponential moving average crossover strategy.

You can find the code for the bot itself in the `bot/` subdirectory. It is written in Haskell, and instructions for running the bot or developing it can be found in that folder.

The bot's performance is logged in a database and the `analysis/` subdirectory contains some data visualization.
